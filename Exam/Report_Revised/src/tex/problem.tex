\section{The Problem}

The problem is to figure out the performance difference between C\# and Python by running a quick-sort algorithm. Since we finished our Algorithms and Datastructures course, I've wanted to figure out how big the difference actually is.

\noindent The reason for using a quick-sort is that it's one of the more commonly used algorithms for larger data sets\cite{best_sort_alg},
