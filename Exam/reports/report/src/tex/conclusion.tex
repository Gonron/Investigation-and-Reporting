\section*{Conclusion}

By comparing C\# and Python, I concluded that C\# is roughly 14x faster then Python. This was not a surprise. Following these result I decided to try and run the Python code with PyPy, which resulted in a measly 31\% difference from C\#. However you don't always want to utilize PyPy since it doesn't have support for some of the more popular packages.
