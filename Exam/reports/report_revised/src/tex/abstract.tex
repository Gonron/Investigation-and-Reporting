\section*{Abstract}

There's many situation where performance means everything for a program to be successful. Therefore it's important to choose the right programming language for the task. In this paper we're going to investigate the difference in execution time between C\# and Python. I'll conclude which is faster based on execution times of an quick-sort algorithm, finally I'll discuss their use cases based on the results and features.
